## Notes and Limitations  
- Supports official VR (JP and Steam)

- Unknown compatibility with kPlug  

- The various keyboard shortcuts from this plugin can be used with a voice to keystroke software to allow hands free operation, which is especially useful in VR.  
For the keyboard shortcuts to work in VR, the game's window must have focus.  

- When manually forcing precum animation, piston speed will be fixed at max value and cannot be adjusted.
